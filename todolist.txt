1. Expectation of TTI operator
2. Particle current: why left current does not converge to the right current?
3. Imaginary infinite GTEMPO: how to overcome the inaccuracy at the beginning?
4. Rewriting the code from GrassmannTensor to imporve efficiency and easier integration of GPU
5. Higher order extension
6. Continuous time extension
7. Optimal control

Killer applications:
1. Seebeck effect and Onsager relation
2. Non-equilibrium DMFT
3. Two-orbital calculation on the real-time axis, low temperature or off-diagonal coupling
